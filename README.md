# graphql
This repo is to test how graphql works.

## For frontend devs.

There are a couple things you need to install

### Requirements

- **Node**. Mine is 16.14.0, but I don't see why newer versions wouldnt work.

### Steps

After cloning the repo and being in the `main branch` run this next command to run the app:

```bash
rm yarn.lock && npm i && npm start
```

You'll see how the console prints out a URI to localhost port 4000, direct yourself there to make some experimentation.
